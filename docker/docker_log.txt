-Worked through the two issues last time, and got through 2/3 of the steps in
building that Docker image. However, there is a strange issue on step 3.
I tried using the official bash 3.2 Dockerfile to see if the issue was caused
by my modifications, but I got even more errors from that one. It seems there
may be compatibility issues between the newer versions of Docker and that 
Dockerfile, which is quite old at this point. It may be wiser to simply re-
write the bash script to use the latest version of bash; there should not be
too many modifications needed.

# 8/2/24

-Installed buildx with pacman and ran 'docker buildx build' for the first time
on the bash3.2 dockerfile, got this error:

WARNING: No output specified with docker-container driver. Build result will 
only remain in the build cache. To push result image into registry use --push 
or to load image into docker use --load
ERROR: failed to solve: failed to read dockerfile: open Dockerfile: no such 
file or directory

-However, the container does show up under 'docker ps'.

-Upon asking ChatGPT, I learned that the command I ran expects a dockerfile
named, simply, 'Dockerfile'; mine had a different name. This is the command:

docker buildx build --tag bash3.2:v1 .

-I can either rename my dockerfile to 'Dockerfile' or I can use a slightly
different command that specifies the existing filename.

-The other issue was that I needed to use the '--load' option to specify that
I wanted to load the resultant Docker image into the local Docker instance.


# First attempt at building image

>docker build -t bash-git-gh:v0 bash_git.dockerfile 

DEPRECATED: The legacy builder is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
            Install the buildx component to build images with BuildKit:
            https://docs.docker.com/go/buildx/

unable to prepare context: context must be a directory: /home/slushy/GitHub/Python/py-small-projects/docker/bash_git.dockerfile

-Guess I need to install BuildX...
