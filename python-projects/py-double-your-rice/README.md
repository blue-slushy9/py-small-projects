Did you ever hear the old story about the peasant who approached his king, who told the peasant that he would give him whatever he wanted? And then the peasant said that he simply wished to begin with one grain of rice, and then double it over every square on a chess board? This program is similar to that story, you begin by entering a number, and then the program doubles this number based on the number of days you enter.
